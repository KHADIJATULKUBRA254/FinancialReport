## System Overview
AlphaInsight is a high-performance analytical tool for automating extraction and analysis of financial data from annual reports and similar documents. It converts PDF documents into structured financial intelligence, focusing on balance sheets, profit & loss statements, and comparative analytics across fiscal periods.

Key goals:
- Accurate extraction of financial metrics from complex PDFs (up to 300+ pages)
- Per-user private persistence and searchable history
- Clear visualizations and executive summaries for quick decision-making
- Extensible reasoning pipeline for future interactive Q&A features

---

## Frontend Architecture
Built with React (v19) using a functional component approach and unidirectional data flow for predictable state management. Emphasis is on performance, accessibility, and modular components.

### State Management
Primary state primitives:
- user: authenticated user object or null
- analysisResult: parsed JSON output of a document analysis
- history: array of past analysis entries
- currentView: 'Public' | 'Workspace'
- loading / error states for UX feedback

Example lifecycle (pseudo-code):

```pseudo
FUNCTION AppController:
  STATE user = NULL
  STATE analysisResult = NULL
  STATE history = []
  STATE currentView = 'Public'

  ON mount:
    LISTEN to Authentication changes
    IF user exists:
      SET currentView = 'Workspace'
      START listening to database at /users/{uid}/history
    ELSE:
      SET currentView = 'Public'
END FUNCTION
```

Best practices:
- Use context + lightweight global store (React Context or Zustand) for auth & theme
- Virtualized lists for long history logs (react-window / react-virtualized)
- Suspense + lazy for large components to reduce initial bundle size

---

## Authentication & Security Layer
Identity management leverages a cloud authentication gateway (e.g., Firebase Auth, Auth0, or a self-hosted OAuth2 provider). All analytical results are strictly scoped per user account.

### Session Lifecycle

```pseudo
FUNCTION HandleAuth(mode, credentials):
  TRY:
    IF mode == 'signup':
      result = CloudAuth.createAccount(credentials.email, credentials.password)
      CloudAuth.updateProfile(result.user, credentials.name)
    ELSE IF mode == 'login':
      CloudAuth.signIn(credentials.email, credentials.password)
    SET UserState = Authenticated
    CLOSE AuthModal
  CATCH Error:
    DISPLAY UserFriendlyError(Error.message)
END FUNCTION
```

Security considerations:
- Enforce strong password policies and 2FA for elevated plans
- Use HTTPS + HSTS for all endpoints
- Minimize sensitive data exposure in logs
- Apply principle of least privilege for database rules and API tokens

## PDF Analysis Pipeline (Core Logic)
This is the proprietary core: convert PDF pixels → text/structure → financial schema. Pipeline stages:
1. Ingestion: accept/stream PDF (support large files)
2. Preprocessing: optimize images, OCR (if needed), page segmentation
3. Reasoning/Extraction: feed page-level context to model(s) or rule-based extractors
4. Post-processing: validate numeric values, currency normalization, attach metadata
5. Persistence: store structured JSON and raw artifacts in user history

### Ingestion Stage
- Accept files up to 300+ pages
- Prefer streaming to avoid high-memory usage
- Optionally perform page-wise processing and incremental saves

### Document Transformation (Pseudo-code)

```pseudo
FUNCTION ProcessDocument(selectedFile):
  SET LoadingState = 'Analyzing...'

  BASE64 = ConvertFileToBase64(selectedFile)

  SystemInstruction = """
  You are a Senior Auditor.
  Target: Balance Sheet & Profit & Loss.
  Output: JSON schema {
    Company: string,
    Year: int,
    Currency: string,
    MetricsList: [
      { name: string, value: number, notes?: string, sourcePage: int }
    ]
  }
  """

  SEND { base64: BASE64, instruction: SystemInstruction } TO ReasoningEngine
  RECEIVE rawResponse

  parsed = ParseJSON(rawResponse)
  UPDATE DashboardState WITH parsed
  SAVE parsed TO Database /users/{uid}/history/{uniqueID}
END FUNCTION
```

Implementation notes:
- Use streaming & chunking for large files (upload parts + server-side assembly)
- Include page-level provenance for traceability (page numbers, bounding boxes)
- Validate parsed JSON against a strict schema before persisting

---

## Real-time Persistence & History Management
Analyses persist automatically—no explicit "Save" required. Real-time sync enables immediate access on all user devices.

### Database Pathing Strategy
Use hierarchical, per-user pathing, e.g.:
- /users/{uid}/history/{analysisID}

Each history entry:
- id, timestamp, company, year(s), currency, metrics summary, raw JSON, preview thumbnails, provenance links

### Synchronization Logic (Pseudo-code)

```pseudo
FUNCTION SyncHistory(currentUserID):
  REF = DatabaseRef(`/users/${currentUserID}/history`)

  ON (value change at REF):
    data = GET snapshot.value
    entries = SORT data BY timestamp DESC
    UPDATE HistorySidebarUI(entries)
END FUNCTION
```

Considerations:
- Index common query fields (company, year, timestamp)
- Use pagination and lazy-loading for long histories
- Store blobs (PDFs/thumbnails) in object storage and reference them from DB

---

## Data Visualization & Analytics
Visualizations use SVG-based charting libraries (Recharts, D3, or vx) for responsive, accessible charts.

- Dashboard: grid layout (1fr / 2fr) combining executive summary + charts
- Charts: line charts for trends, bar charts for period comparisons, waterfall for cash-flow
- Export: CSV/Excel export for Analyst Pro plan

### Comparative Growth Formulas (Pseudo-code)

```pseudo
FUNCTION CalculateYoYGrowth(currentVal, prevVal):
  IF prevVal == 0 OR prevVal IS NULL:
    RETURN 0

  growthPercent = ((currentVal - prevVal) / prevVal) * 100

  IF growthPercent > 0:
    indicator = { symbol: "↑", color: "emerald" }
  ELSE:
    indicator = { symbol: "↓", color: "rose" }

  RETURN { growthPercent, indicator }
END FUNCTION
```

UX tips:
- Use color-blind-safe palettes
- Provide hover tooltips with exact values & provenance (source page)
- Allow users to toggle normalization (e.g., per-share, per-1000 units)

---

## UI/UX Engineering Principles
Design follows a depth-first focus model: important content layered with z-index and backdrop filters to keep context while focusing on details.

- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, semantic markup
- Performance: code-splitting, memoization, and virtualization for large lists
- Responsiveness: mobile-first layouts with clear breakpoints
- Theming: support light/dark modes with CSS variables

### Component Modularity
- Header: context-aware links (active/inactive states)
- HistoryList: virtualized scrolling
- Dashboard: modular grid (1fr / 2fr)
- Widgets: small, reusable components for metric cards, trend charts, and tables

---

## Future Roadmap & Extensibility
Planned phases:

- Phase 2 — Interactive Contextual Chat (Q&A)
  - Provide a floating chat widget that uses persisted document context buffer to answer targeted queries (e.g., risk factors, tax reconciliations)
  - Store context references with provenance to show supporting pages/lines

- Phase 3 — Institutional Monetization
  - Free: limited history, basic metrics
  - Analyst Pro: unlimited reports, detailed cash-flow extraction, Excel exports
  - Corporate: multi-user collaboration, team management, API access

Extensibility notes:
- Expose a v1 read-only API for enterprise usage
- Plugin architecture for custom extractors and visualizations
- Audit logs and role-based access control for Corporate customers

---

## Conclusion
AlphaInsight pairs a scalable frontend with a robust, auditable document reasoning pipeline to transform long-form financial reports into actionable intelligence. The architecture emphasizes privacy, traceability, and extensibility to support institutional adoption.
